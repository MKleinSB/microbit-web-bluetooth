This repository contains examples of using Web Bluetooth with micro:bit.

## [Scan](https://MKleinSB.github.io/microbit-web-bluetooth/microbit-web-bluetooth-scan.html)

Scan Bluetooth devices whose name starts with "BBC micro:bit". After connecting to a micro:bit via BLE, it prints all the available services and characteristics.

## [Temperature](https://ngammarano.github.io/microbit-web-bluetooth/microbit-web-bluetooth-temperature.html)

Scan Bluetooth devices whose name starts with "BBC micro:bit". After connecting to a micro:bit via BLE, it allows to interact with the micro:bit through its Bluetooth Temperature service.
* **Temperature**: notify temperature data in degrees Celsius.
* **Temperature Period**: read or write the frequency with which temperature data is reported in milliseconds.

## [UART](https://ngammarano.github.io/microbit-web-bluetooth/microbit-web-bluetooth-uart.html)

Scan Bluetooth devices whose name starts with "BBC micro:bit". After connecting to a micro:bit via BLE, it allows to interact with the micro:bit through its Bluetooth UART service.
* **TX**: indicate the string (micro:bit transmits and browser receives through WebBLE).
* **RX**: write the string (micro:bit receives and browser transmits through WebBLE).

## [LEDs](https://ngammarano.github.io/microbit-web-bluetooth/microbit-web-bluetooth-leds.html)

Scan Bluetooth devices whose name starts with "BBC micro:bit". After connecting to a micro:bit via BLE, it allows to interact with the micro:bit through its Bluetooth LED service.
* **LED Matrix State**: read or write the state of the 5x5 LED matrix.
* **LED Text**: write a text to be displayed in the LED matrix.
* **Scrolling Delay** : read or write the delay in milliseconds for scrolling the text.

## [Buttons](https://ngammarano.github.io/microbit-web-bluetooth/microbit-web-bluetooth-button.html)

Scan Bluetooth devices whose name starts with "BBC micro:bit". After connecting to a micro:bit via BLE, it allows to interact with the micro:bit through its Bluetooth Button service.
* **Button A State**: notify state of button A (0=not pressed, 1=short pressed, 2=long pressed).
* **Button B State**: notify state of button B (0=not pressed, 1=short pressed, 2=long pressed).

## [Accelerometer](https://ngammarano.github.io/microbit-web-bluetooth/microbit-web-bluetooth-accelerometer.html)

Scan Bluetooth devices whose name starts with "BBC micro:bit". After connecting to a micro:bit via BLE, it allows to interact with the micro:bit through its Bluetooth Accelerometer service.
* **Accelerometer Data**: notify accelerometer data of axes x, y and z.
* **Accelerometer Period**: read or write the frequency with which accelerometer data is reported in milliseconds.

## [Magnetometer](https://ngammarano.github.io/microbit-web-bluetooth/microbit-web-bluetooth-magnetometer.html)

Scan Bluetooth devices whose name starts with "BBC micro:bit". After connecting to a micro:bit via BLE, it allows to interact with the micro:bit through its Bluetooth Magnetometer service.
* **Magnetometer Data**: notify magnetometer data of axes x, y and z.
* **Magnetometer Period**: read or write the frequency with which magnetometer data is reported in milliseconds.
* **Magnetometer Bearing**: notify the compass bearing in degrees from north.
* **Magnetometer Calibration**: notify or write the calibration state (0=state unknown, 1=calibration requested, 2=calibration completed OK, 3=calibration completed with error).
